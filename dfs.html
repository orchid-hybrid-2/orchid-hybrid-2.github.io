<H3 CLASS=ABSTRACT>Abstract:</H3>
<P CLASS=ABSTRACT>It is attractive to regard an algorithm as composed
of the logic determining what the results are and the control
determining how the result is obtained.  Logic programmers
like to regard programming as controlled deduction, and there
have been several proposals for controlling the deduction
expressed by a Prolog program and not always using Prolog's
normal backtracking algorithm.  The present note
discusses a map coloring program proposed by Pereira and Porto
and two coloring algorithms that can be regarded as control applied to
its logic.  However, the control mechanisms required go far beyond
those that have been contemplated in the Prolog literature.

<P>
        The formula isn't precise, and it won't be precise until
someone proposes a precise and generally accepted notion of how
control is to be added to an expression of the logic of a program.
Nevertheless, the idea is attractive, and I believe it can be made to work
for some interesting class of programs.  It is analogous to my comparison
of epistemology and heuristics or Chomsky's competence and performance.
<P>
        Pereira and Porto (1980) give a logic program for coloring planar
maps with four colors and discuss how ``selective
backtracking'' can reduce the search involved in coloring a map from that
done by a straightforward PROLOG execution of the same
program.
<P>
        The discussion by Pereira and Porto treats coloring maps purely as
an example of logic programming, and the improvements they discuss apply
to all logic program systems.  We shall consider two mathematical ideas
about map coloring that go back to Kempe (1879), the paper containing the
original false proof of the four color theorem.  While Kempe's proof
was false, the ideas are good and were used in almost all subsequent work
including the recent successful proof.
<P>
        The question is whether an algorithm
involving these ideas can be regarded as a form of control adjoined to
the basic logic program or whether they necessarily involve a new program.
If they are to be regarded as control structures, it is not yet clear how
they are best expressed.  Of course, it is not hard to write a completely
new program in PROLOG or any other language expressing the algorithms, and
this has been done.  The interpreted programs color a map of the United States.
  However, it is also interesting to try to regard the
algorithms as control attached to the Pereira-Porto logic program for
coloring a specific map.

<P>
        Kempe (or perhaps someone still earlier)
noticed that countries with three or fewer neighbors present
no problem.  No matter how the rest of the map is colored, there is always
a color available for such a country.
We use this in to improve a Pereira-Porto map coloring program by
``reducing the map'' by
removing such countries and doing our trial-and-error coloring on the
reduced map, confident that once the reduced map is colored, the coloring
can be extended to the omitted countries.
<P>
        The idea is even more powerful, because eliminating countries with
three or fewer neighbors may remove enough neighbors from some other
countries so that they have three or fewer neighbors and can themselves be
removed.  Therefore, the reduction process should be continued until a
completely reduced map is obtained in which all countries have at least four
neighbors.
  The maps of the states of the U.S. and
the countries of Europe, Asia, Africa and South America all reduce
to null maps when countries with three or fewer neighbors are successively
eliminated
<P>
        Likewise the map of Figure 1 reduces to the empty map.  
Thus we may remove country 4 with two neighbors and country 5 with three
neigbors.  This leaves all the remaining countries with three or fewer
neighbors, so the second cycle of reduction leaves the null map,
reduced map.  Therefore, when we colored in the reverse order
1, 2, 3, 6, 4, 5, each country is colored without changing the
color of any previously colored country.
<P>
        If the programmer performs this reduction before he writes the
goal statement, he will write
<P>

<P>
        This PROLOG program will run with only the most local
backtracking.  Namely, after <I>R</I>1 has been chosen arbitrarily, several
values will have to be tried for each of the variables <I>R</I>1, <I>R</I>2, <I>R</I>3, <I>R</I>6,
<I>R</I>4, and <I>R</I>5,
but once a value has been found that is compatible with the previously
determined variables, it won't have to be changed again.
<P>
        The new PROLOG program is logically equivalent to the previous
program because it is just a rearrangement of the literals of a
conjunction.  However, the programmer has done the control.  The
interesting question is whether the reduction can be expressed in some way
that can be regarded as adding control to the original logic, i.e.,
without changing the original logic.
